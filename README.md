# LogicBox – Pattern & Number Analysis Tool (Python)

## Project Overview

LogicBox is a console-based Python application that implements structured control flow and logical problem-solving techniques within a menu-driven interface.

The system combines pattern generation and numerical range analysis to demonstrate iterative programming and decision-based execution.

---

## Objective

This project focuses on applying:

* Conditional logic
* Loop-based iteration
* Match-case control flow
* Arithmetic computation
* Structured console interaction

---

## Core Functionalities

### Pattern Generator

* Accepts user-defined row input
* Generates right-angled star patterns
* Demonstrates nested loop construction

### Number Analyzer

* Accepts user-defined numeric range
* Identifies numbers as even or odd
* Computes total sum of the range
* Displays structured output

### Exit Option

* Controlled program termination

## Technical Implementation

* Match-case structure
* For-loop and range iteration
* Conditional branching (`if-else`)
* Accumulator pattern for summation
* Menu-driven console navigation

---

## Learning Outcome

* Strengthened control flow logic
* Applied iterative problem-solving techniques
* Practiced structured user interaction design
